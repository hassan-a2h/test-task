The main entity is a user: email, name, role.

go to backend direcotry 'cd backend'
and run 'npm install' because the backend uses its own dependencies.

The default PORT is 3000.

# Frontend

Uses ReactJS and lets the user add and remove users data.
run 'npm run dev' to visit the root route

The app uses React Router to achieve full SPA experience.
